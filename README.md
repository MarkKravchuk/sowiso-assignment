# SOWISO developer assignment
From a software engineering perspective, the core of SOWISO is to
generate exercises, display them in a browser, capture the answer,
evaluate the answer and give feedback on it. This assignment is to simulate
that process.

### Goal
The goal is to make an exercise of the type a + b where both a and b are
random numbers. The end user gets this exercise presented in a web
browser and can submit an answer. The answer should somehow be
evaluated, telling the user whether it was correct.
### Software
The assignment is developed using React framework of Javascript language.
### Time
This assignment was completed in less than 4 hours.
### Code
The code is publicly available on GitHub account
